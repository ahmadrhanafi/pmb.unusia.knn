                    the majority of categories in K-NN. The goal of this algorithm is to classify 
                    new objects based on attributes and training samples. The classifier does not 
                    use any model for matching and is only based on memory. Given a query point, 
                    it will find a number of k objects or training points closest to the query point. 
                    Classification uses the most votes among the classifications of k objects. 
                    The K-NN algorithm uses neighborhood classification as a predictive value for the new query instance.",
